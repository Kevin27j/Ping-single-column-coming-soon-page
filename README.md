This is a solution to the Ping single column coming soon page challenge on Frontend Mentor
(https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ping-single-column-coming-soon-page-5cadd051fec04111f7b848da). 

## Description

This is a form validation web page built with the SASS extension for CSS.
Here I used Javascript to validate the email input and return error messages for empty inputs and wrong formatted emails.
The page is also fully responsive.
